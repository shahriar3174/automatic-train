Example git repo for CIS 1051 Spring 2024

I encountered challenges right from the beginning of this project. I couldn't get Streamlit to run on VS Code or Jupyter Notebook. After extensive searching, I found a workaround by using Google Colab to execute my code. This project has been a learning experience in more ways than oneâ€”I gained new insights into data visualization, stock market analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations. These were skills I never imagined I would acquire when I first started. The main motivation for this project was to build a data science portfolio, and I thought this project would be a great start.

Although I've completed the project, I plan to add more features in the future. For instance, I want to enable users from anywhere in the world to input investment amounts in their local currency and receive outputs in that same currency. I have other ideas too, and I look forward to implementing them.

Finally, I just want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to build this project and for all the support along the way.
