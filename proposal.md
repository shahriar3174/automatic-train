# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock Market Predictor: Analyzing Trends for Informed Investments

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project aims to develop a software tool that analyzes historical stock market data to predict future trends, helping investors make informed decisions.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The stock market prediction program will leverage machine learning algorithms(which I will learn a bit for the project) to analyze historical stock data, spotting trends, and forecasting future price movements. It will sport a straightforward interface where users can input specific stocks or indices they wish to analyze. The software will generate visual representations of past price data, conduct trend assessments, and construct predictive models. These models will consider various factors, including technical indicators, sentiment analysis from news articles, and past market behavior. Users will have the flexibility to tailor their analysis criteria and receive suggestions for potential investment prospects. To develop this program, we'll harness Python programming language tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, which I'm familiar with. As there are some things that I am not familiar with yet, I'll rely on resources like Google and YouTube to explore additional libraries and techniques for data analysis and machine learning. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No. But As I am hoping to switch to Data science Major, this could be a great project to put in my portfolio hence I thought about getting started with it right away.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No, I am not planning to work with anyone.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be developing a functional program that can analyze historical stock market data and provide basic predictive insights.At the same time I would learn how to deal with list of Data

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome be implementing more advanced machine learning models which will be interactive, integrating real-time data sources, and refining the user interface for improved usability.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be creating a comprehensive stock market prediction tool capable of accurately forecasting price movements, providing valuable insights for investors, and demonstrating proficiency in data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To further develop the project, I'll start researching machine learning algorithms tailored for time series analysis and sentiment analysis methods applicable to financial markets. Enhancing my Python skills, particularly in Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, will be crucial for implementing these algorithms effectively. Additionally, I'll explore web development frameworks like Flask or Django that would help me create a user-friendly interface.
