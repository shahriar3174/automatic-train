Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have gone through several tutorials to understand stock price prediction and have begun using Alpha Vantage for real-time data collection. This has given me a good foundation to work with stock price data and develop basic prediction models.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have some things to finish for my stock price prediction project. I want to work on using more advanced models, like machine learning and deep learning. I also need to improve the way I process the stock data, create charts to see how the prices change over time, and do some backtesting to check how well the models predict the prices. To make the project user-friendly, I'm going to use Streamlit to build the interface. I also have to write the documentation so other people can understand how it all works.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

None
